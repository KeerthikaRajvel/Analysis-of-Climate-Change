## Project Description:

Our main focus in this project to analyze several parameters the influence climate change. We aimed at analyzing three factors namely: green house gas emissions, droughts and population. Greenhouse gas emissions have nearly doubled atmospheric temperature in the last decade and have significantly resulted in lower rainfall causing droughts.Areas such as agriculture, transportation and energy are massively impacted by droughts and millions of forests have been wiped out as a result of droughts in the past decade.Factors such as climate, availability of water and population influence agricultural crop yields.

In this project:

1. We estimated and visualized the carbon footprint per country based on the data provided by World Bank
2. We built a Time Series Analysis model on the carbon footprint results calculated in the previous step and predict the values for the next 19 years
3. We predicted drought using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI)
4. We analyzed the growth in population over time and understand its correlation to agricultural yield

## Dataset:

#### 1.  World Bank
https://data.world/worldbank/climate-change-data- 
Provides information on world climate impact, greenhouse gas emissions, energy use, mortality rates etc.
The dataset consists of data ranging from 1990 to 2008, providing information on 233 countries on 56 different climatic aspects.
The dataset approximately has around 20,000 instances.
#### 2. NOAA 
https://digital.csic.es/handle/10261/153475
Provides Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) values along with temporal and spatial information.
The dataset consists of data ranging from 1990 to 2015, providing latitude, longitude and temporal information.
The dataset approximately has around 1 million instances.

## Code:

The code for each component is available in their individual folders. All Analyses were done in jupyter interactive ipython notebooks. 

## Key Results:

Key results consists of screenshots of graphs,charts, execution trace, and results.
